# Global Air Quality Dashboard

## Description

The global air quality dashboard is an interactive web application designed to visualize real-time air quality data across the globe. Built using Dash and Python,
this app displays air quality data from the OpenAQ API on an interactive map, graph, and table. 

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) - Data visualization components.

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

- [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) - Sensor locations and air quality data.

The application is deployed through pythonanywhere.

- [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Features

- Real-time data fetched from OpenAQ.
- Interactive map with clickable data points that reveal recent data from a location.
- Data displayed on the map as markers or a density heatmap.
- Region focus for quick map navigation.
- Data visualization with Dash graphs, gauges, and tables.

## FAQ
<b>What are PM 10 and PM 2.5?</b>
<br>
These are two types of particulate matter (PM) in the air. They are not a single pollutant, but a mixture of many including dirt, smoke, mold, metals, and more.
These pollutants are defined by their diameter, PM 10 being a diameter smaller than 10 micrometers and PM 2.5 being smaller than 2.5 micrometers. These particles
are small enough to be inhaled, meaning they can get deep into the lungs and the bloodstream which causes health issues.

<b>Why monitor air quality?</b>
<br>
Monitoring air quality is important for public health and environmental reasons. Both PM 10 and PM 2.5 can cause or worsen health problems, especially in 
vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Particulate matter data can also help with identifying sources of pollution, monitoring the effects of
natural events such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions, and tracking changes in ecosystems over time.
